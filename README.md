## blksize
A conversion of the blksize program written by Moshix to Rexx, [see Moshix's MVS repository](https://github.com/moshix/mvs).
I used this to test various things in mgrossman's BREXX implemenation for MVS 3.8.
The program will calculate an optimal block size for files on a specified DASD type and with a given logical record length.

## GAW8051
A System/370 assembler program to compress and decompress records, callable from PL/I.
